## Another moderation, fun, and integrated Discord bot.  This time maybe with some more cool stuff? 

I plan to make this for my personal servers, but also suitable for production in community servers if need be.  I want to add some cool functionality that integrates with gaming services, Minecraft servers, and other things as I come up with ideas, as well as having high levels of configuration and simple moderation functionality.  I want it to kind of serve as a hub for community integration across platforms *and maybe will relate to some of my planned projects in that space hint hint*. 

If you want to keep up with my progress, you can check out the project's [Trello Page](https://trello.com/b/cSAU2KvK/prometheum-bot) where I plan to document my progress.  This probably won't be my main project, but more of something on the side, just because I'd like to expand my horizons to something other than Discord bots and automation scripts, but at least this is a kind of introduction into back-end development.
